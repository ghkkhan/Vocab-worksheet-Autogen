# Setup and Usage

To start the program, create a file and fill it with words and definitions as defined later in the document.

Once done, start the program on a command line and select "Add vocab set." This will set up the databank and carry over all the words you've given it...
You can add as many words as you want, in as many different files as you want.

Once you have plenty of words, you can command the program to create a writing practice worksheet for you using words from the databank. The words may be picked at random or using some options detailed below.
You may also optionally create a test file by use of such options.

Lastly, you have the option to update the stats for the words that you just "tested" on. Just state weather you got the word correct or not on the most recent test and the program will update the word's data accordingly.
